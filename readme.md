Creek model is an R script for basic hydraulic modelling of waterways developed
for the purpose of preparing applications for controlled activity approval in
NSW. The use was made clear to me working for Mulloon Consulting, Contracting
and Certifying.

Creek model was developed using R version 3.6.1 on GNU/linux and tested with
R version 3.6.2 on Windows 10.

Creek Model requires the sp library to be installed. You may need to run
install.packages('sp') from an R prompt before first using this script.

Creek Model is licenced under the GNU General Public Licence (Version 3)
